adapted from Winston Churchill


3 oz. London dry gin

GARNISH:   lemon peel

Stir gin in a cocktail shaker with ice until 
very cold. Turn toward the direction of France 
and bow before straining into a shallow glass 
and garnish. 

ED. NOTE:  During Churchill's Second World War 
           heyday at 10 Downing Street, it was
           fashionable to use French vermouths 
           like Noilly Pratt in a martini.
